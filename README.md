This project is a flutter Escrow Frontend Application Template.

I built the backend with Laravel but we never saw the daylight of production and I left the team. I decided to build the mobile project out with flutter. I hope you can copy and use this for your own work. I'm also welcoming feedback and corrections to my design/architecture.

My intention is to allow people build and scaffold apps quickly. Feel free to use, edit, modify, clone. etc. 

I'll keep updating this project.

I can try and answer questions, so feel free to ask.

God bless you. (yeah! I'm a child of God)
